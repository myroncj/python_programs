Problem:

There are 6 students in a class whose ages range between 18-22. The details (name, age) are taken partially from the webpage and partially from the console and saved into the database. The data of number of students versus age is to be visuallised and saved in the system for future reference. The details of the students whose age is greater than 20 are to be seperatly saved in a file. The details in the file are to be displayed in a webpage.
