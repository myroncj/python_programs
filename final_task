A GPS device measures a position at every 's' seconds...The positions corresponding to a specific trip are stored as x,y coordinates in a file/database, Where x and x=y are integer values. 

Starting values of 's' is given as an input along with x and y for 10 positions.

i. Plot a two dimensional curve of the corresponding data in a file or database.

ii. Plot the velocity in the x direction versus time in one graph and velocity in  y direction in another graph.

Use the formula for velocity in x at time t as the standard formula for.
